# Marcov_Chain_PY
The first project about Marcov Chains I have done. Using pandas and numpy, if you type a word that exists in the bee.txt it will generate a random sentence. Using end words it will most likely sound believable, because the idea behind it is that it puts the words before the punctuation mark in a seperate group. It then traverses the table.
